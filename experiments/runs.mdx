## Concept
A run represents the execution of a single datapoint from a dataset within an [experiment](/experiments/experiments). A `runner` function processes the input data
and generates an output that adheres to the dataset's schema.

Runs are important for diagnosing model performance at a granular level, allowing developers to effectively debug their systems
and architectures.

## Creating a Run

A run is automatically created for you when you execute an experiment via `montelo.experiments.createAndRun`.

Each run is tied to the one input of the `runner` function and the output it generates.

## Analyzing Runs
Analyzing runs provides valuable feedback on the model's performance, helping you understand:

- How closely the actual outputs match the expected outputs.
- Any errors in the system's responses.
- Areas for improvement in the system's architecture.
