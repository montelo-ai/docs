## Overview
As your project grows, you will need to manage more and more prompts and tools.

For example, you may find yourself writing huge prompts and tools that become difficult to manage:

```typescript
await montelo.openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      message: `Some massive prompt
that spans
multiple lines
`,
    },
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      name: 'some_function',
      description: 'Some function description',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          // massive object
        },
      },
    },
  ]
});
```

Montelo provides a way to manage these prompts and tools in a more organized way. We abstract the prompts and tools into
separate files and folders, so that they can be easily managed and maintained. After using Montelo, your code will look like this:

```typescript
import { prompts, AllTools } from "path/to/folder";

await montelo.openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: prompts.some_massive_prompt,
  tools: AllTools,
});
```


## Benefits

In addition to being more organized, doing this approach allows Montelo to be able to manage your prompts and tools version
automatically, without you having to worry about it. We'll also be able to track performance and metrics for each prompt and tool,
and how they improve or degrade over time.
