## Sign up for Montelo

To get started, you need to first [sign up](https://app.montelo.ai/auth/register) for an account.

## Installing the SDK

Start by installing Montelo.

```sh
npm install montelo
```

## Getting your API Key

After setting up your account, you can find your API key for the environment you want to use from the dashboard.

<Note>Each project has several environments, and each environment has it’s own API Key.</Note>

When developing in a team, it's a good idea to create a new environment for each developer.
This way, developers can work independently without interfering with each other's work.

### Setting the Montelo API Key

With your API key in hand, you can now set up the SDK.
Either include the API key as an environment variable called `MONTELO_API_KEY` or pass it as an argument to the `Montelo` constructor.

<CodeGroup>
```dotenv .env
MONTELO_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo();
```
</CodeGroup>

Or to manually set the API key:

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo({
  montelo: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
  },
});
```

### Setting LLM Provider API Keys

Montelo simplifies the process of using multiple LLM providers by providing a single interface to interact with them.
We use the same authentication method as the LLM providers themselves, so you can use the same API keys you already have.

To use a specific LLM provider, you need to set the API key for that provider.
For example, to use OpenAI, you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable according to the [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node) provided by OpenAI.

<CodeGroup>
```dotenv .env
MONTELO_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo();
```
</CodeGroup>

Or, to manually set the API key:

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo({
  openai: {
    apiKey: "your-openai-api-key",
  },
});
```

## Start using Montelo

Now that you have the SDK set up, you can start using Montelo.

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo();

await montelo.openai.chat.completions.create({
  name: "A name for this completion",
  ... // other OpenAI parameters
});
```

<Note>The `name` parameter is a required field for Montelo for all completions. It is used to identify the completion in the Montelo dashboard.</Note>

And that's it! After following these steps, you should have Montelo set up and ready to use.

You should now be able to view logs and metrics in the Montelo dashboard.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Montelo set up, you can start using the SDK to build your LLM applications.

Next, check out how to group multiple LLM calls into a single [trace](/traces).
