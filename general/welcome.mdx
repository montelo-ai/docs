## What is Montelo?

Montelo is the LLM DevOps platform for TypeScript. Montelo provides tools for logging, tracing, and monitoring
for your LLM applications.

Our flagship feature, [Traces](/traces/traces), allows you to see the flow of your LLMs and debug it with ease, all in one place.

## What are Montelo Crews?

Montelo has developed the first Agent framework for TypeScript, called Crews, which integrates nicely with our platform.

Crews is a framework that allows developers to build LLM applications using multiple agents that can communicate with
each other to solve bigger tasks.

Read more about them in the [Crews documentation](/crews/introduction).
