Datasets are integral to evaluating LLMs in Montelo.
You can create datasets to evaluate the performance of your LLMs on specific tasks.

## Concept

A dataset is a collection of [datapoints](/datasets/datapoints) that adhere to an input and expected output schema. For example,
consider a dataset where the input is a topic of interest, and the expected output is an article about that topic:

```typescript
Input Schema:
{
  topic: "string"
}

Expected output Schema:
{
  article: "string"
}
```

Every datapoint in this dataset will have a `topic` field in the input and an `article` field in the output.

You can then run [experiments](/experiments/experiments) against this dataset to evaluate the performance of your LLMs.

## Schema Types

The dataset schema is an object of key-value pairs, where the key is the field name and the value is the field type.

Montelo supports the following field types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `array`
- `object`

## Creating a Dataset

### Via the SDK

This will create a new dataset in the environment for the API key used.

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

const dataset = await montelo.datasets.create({
  name: "Article Dataset",
  description: "Datasets for AI articles",
  inputSchema: {
    topic: "string",
  },
  outputSchema: {
    article: "string",
  },
});
```

### Via the UI

You can create a dataset via the UI by navigating to the Datasets page and clicking on the `Create Dataset` button.
