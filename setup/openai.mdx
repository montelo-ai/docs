title: OpenAI
---

The [OpenAI Node.js SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node?tab=readme-ov-file#openai-node-api-library) exposes convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript.

The OpenAI constructor takes in the object defined below.

<ResponseField name="OpenAI Constructor Options">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField path="apiKey" type="string">
      Defaults to `process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY']`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="organization" type="string">
      Defaults to `process.env['OPENAI_ORG_ID']`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="baseUrl" type="string">
      Override the default base URL for the API, e.g., `https://api.example.com/v2/`.

      Defaults to `process.env['OPENAI_BASE_URL']`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="timeout" type="number">
      The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the client should wait for a response
      from the server before timing out a single request.

      Note that request timeouts are retried by default, so in a worst-case scenario you may wait
      much longer than this timeout before the promise succeeds or fails.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="httpAgent" type="Agent">
      An HTTP agent used to manage HTTP(S) connections.

      If not provided, an agent will be constructed by default in the Node.js environment, otherwise no agent is used.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="fetch" type="Fetch">
      Specify a custom `fetch` function implementation.

      If not provided, we use `node-fetch` on Node.js and otherwise expect that `fetch` is defined globally.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="maxRetries" type="number" default={2}>
      The maximum number of times that the client will retry a request in case of a temporary failure, like a network
      error or a 5XX error from the server.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="defaultHeaders" type="Headers">
      Default headers to include with every request to the API.

      These can be removed in individual requests by explicitly setting the header to `undefined` or `null` in request
      options.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="defaultQuery" type="DefaultQuery">
      Default query parameters to include with every request to the API.

      These can be removed in individual requests by explicitly setting the param to `undefined` in request options.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="dangerouslyAllowBrowser" type="boolean" default={false}>
      By default, client-side use of this library is not allowed, as it risks exposing your secret API credentials to
      attackers.

      Only set this option to `true` if you understand the risks and have appropriate mitigations in place.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

With Montelo, you still have access to these options, simply by adding them to the Montelo constructor.

```typescript
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo({
  openai: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    organization: "your-organization-id",
    timeout: 10000,
    maxRetries: 3,
    ...
  },
});
```
