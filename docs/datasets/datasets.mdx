Datasets are integral to evaluating LLMs in Montelo.
You can create datasets to evaluate the performance of your LLMs on specific tasks.

## Explanation

A dataset is a collection of [datapoints](/datasets/datapoints) that adhere to an input and expected output schema. For example,
consider a dataset where the input is a topic of interest, and the expected output is an article about that topic:

```typescript
Input Schema:
{
  topic: "string"
}

Expected output Schema:
{
  article: "string"
}
```

Every datapoint in this dataset will have a `topic` field in the input and an `article` field in the output.

You can then run [experiments](/experiments/experiments) against this dataset to evaluate the performance of your LLMs.

### Schema Types

The dataset schema is an object of key-value pairs, where the key is the field name and the value is the field type.

Montelo supports the following field types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`

So you can create schemas like:

```typescript
const schema = {
  topic: "string",
  pages: "number",
  isFunny: "boolean",
};
```

## Slug

When you create a dataset, Montelo will also create a unique slug derived from it's name.
You will use the slug when uploading datapoints or running an experiment:

```typescript
await montelo.datapoints.createMany({
  dataset: "", // slug goes here
  datapoints: formattedDatapoints,
});

await montelo.experiments.createAndRun({
  name: "Example",
  dataset: "", // slug goes here
  runner,
  evaluator,,
});
```

You can find the dataset slug on the dataset ID page.

## Creating a Dataset

### Via the SDK

To create a dataset, run `montelo.datasets.create`;

```typescript
const dataset = await montelo.datasets.create({
  name: "Article Dataset",
  description: "Datasets for AI articles",
  inputSchema: { topic: "string" },
  outputSchema: { article: "string" },
});
```

### Via the UI

You can create a dataset via the UI by navigating to the Datasets page and clicking on the `Create Dataset` button.

## Fine-Tuning Dataset

A Fine-Tuning dataset is a dataset designated for fine-tuning. Only fine-tuning datasets can be fine-tuned.

The difference between a fine-tuning dataset and a regular dataset is that the fine-tuning dataset has a pre-set schema
that adheres to the OpenAI fine-tuning [format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format).

More specifically, each datapoint in the dataset must have an input/output that looks like:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "role": "string",
        "content": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's an example datapoint:

```typescript
// input
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the capital of France?"
    }
  ]
}

// output
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a Fine-Tuning Dataset

You can create a fine-tune dataset using the `createFineTune` method, or from the UI by clicking on the Fine-Tune
tab when creating a dataset.

```typescript
const dataset = await montelo.datasets.createFineTune({
  name: "Fine-Tuning Dataset",
  description: "Some description",
});
```

## FAQ

### Why does my dataset need a schema?

A dataset with no schema becomes very messy, very quickly. The schema ensures that all datapoints within the dataset
conform and are alike, making it easier to run evals and analysis on your datasets and experiments.

### Why can't I fine-tune any dataset?

Fine-tuning datasets adhere to the OpenAI fine-tuning [format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format).

If the dataset is not of this specific format, it cannot be fine-tuned. That is why we make an explicit distinction
between the two.

### How do I turn my dataset into a fine-tune dataset?

You'll have to do this manually by getting all the datapoints for the dataset, formatting them, then creating a new
fine-tune dataset and uploading the formatted datapoints.
