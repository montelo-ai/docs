title: Datapoints
description: A datapoint is a single input and expected output pair belonging to a dataset.
icon: circle-dot

## Explanation

Each datapoint represents a single input-output pair that adheres to the schema defined by the [dataset](/datasets/datasets) it belongs to.

The input represents the data that will be provided to the LLM during evaluation, while the expected output represents the desired result.

For example, consider a dataset with the following schema:

```typescript
Input Schema:
{
  topic: "string"
}

Expected output Schema:
{
  article: "string"
}
```

A datapoint in this dataset could look like this:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "topic": "The importance of AI in modern society"
  },
  "expectedOutput": {
    "article": "AI has become increasingly important in modern society ..."
  }
}
```

## Operations

### Create One

To create a single datapoint:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expectedOutput={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
)
```

</CodeGroup>


### Create Many

To create many datapoints in a single efficient operation:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.createMany({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  datapoints: [
    {
      input: { topic: "Soccer" },
      expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
    },
    {
      input: { topic: "Football" },
      expectedOutput: { joke: "Why don't American football teams play soccer? Because they can't handle the competition without taking a timeout!" },
    },
  ],
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create_many(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  datapoints=[
    {
      "input": { "topic": "Soccer" },
      "expectedOutput": { "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
    },
    {
      "input": { "topic": "Football" },
      "expectedOutput": { "joke": "Why don't American football teams play soccer? Because they can't handle the competition without taking a timeout!" },
    },
  ],
)
```

</CodeGroup>


## Train/Test

A datapoint can be in either the train/test split. By default, all datapoints are marked as train.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  split: "TEST" as const
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expectedOutput={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  split="TEST"
)
```

</CodeGroup>


This is useful for when you've fine-tuned a model on the train split, and want to run experiments and evaluations on the test split.

## Metadata

You can add custom metadata to each datapoint.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  metadata: { some: "metadata" }
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expectedOutput={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  metadata={ "some": "metadata" }
)
```

</CodeGroup>


## Fine-Tuning

Each datapoint in a fine-tune dataset must have an input/output that follows this schema:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "role": "string",
        "content": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's an example datapoint:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What's the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
  },
  expectedOutput: {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "assistant",
        content: "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
      }
    ]
  },
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
  },
  "expectedOutput": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
      }
    ]
  },
)
```

</CodeGroup>


## Types

You may supply types to the methods `datapoints.create` and `datapoints.createMany`, like this:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
type DInput = { topic: string };
type DOutput = { joke: string };

await montelo.datapoints.create<DInput, DOutput>({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expectedOutput={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
)
```

</CodeGroup>


This will make it so that TypeScript will complain if `input` does not match `DInput`, or if `expectedOutput` does not
match `DOutput`.

## FAQ

### Does a datapoint have to be associated to a dataset?

Yes, each datapoint belongs to one dataset.

### Can I import a dataset directly from HuggingFace?

We don't support this yet.

### Are the types required?

No! They're optional, but preferred.
