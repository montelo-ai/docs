## Concept
Each datapoint represents a single input-output pair that adheres to the schema defined by the [dataset](/datasets/datasets) it belongs to.

The input represents the data that will be provided to the LLM during evaluation, while the expected output represents the desired result.

For example, consider a dataset with the following schema:

```typescript
Input Schema:
{
  topic: "string"
}

Expected output Schema:
{
  article: "string"
}
```

A datapoint in this dataset could look like this:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "topic": "The importance of AI in modern society"
  },
  "expectedOutput": {
    "article": "AI has become increasingly important in modern society ..."
  }
}
```

## Creating a Datapoint

You can create a datapoint using the SDK. This is useful when you have a local dataset that you want to upload to Montelo.

We also worked really hard on making sure that the SDK is type-safe, so you can be sure that the data you're sending is correct.

Here's an example of how you can create a datapoint using the SDK:

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

// input and output types for the dataset
type DInput = { topic: string };
type DOutput = { article: string };

// some local dataset
const localDataset: Array<{ input: DInput; expectedOutput: DOutput }> = [
  {
    input: { topic: "AI in healthcare" },
    expectedOutput: { article: "Some article about AI in healthcare" },
  },
];

for (const { input, expectedOutput } of localDataset) {
  await montelo.datapoints.create({
    dataset: "dataset-slug", // you can get this from the UI
    input,
    expectedOutput,
  });
}
```

## Code Snippet
You can also get a code snippet from the UI that you can use to create a datapoint using the SDK.
