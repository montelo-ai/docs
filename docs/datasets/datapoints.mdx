title: Datapoints
description: A datapoint is a single input and expected output pair belonging to a dataset.

## Explanation

Each datapoint represents a single input-output pair.

The input represents the data that will be provided to the LLM, and the expected output represents the desired result. Both
must adhere to the OpenAI chat [format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format).

For example, a datapoint could look like:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
  },
  "expectedOutput": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Operations

### Create One

To create a single datapoint:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-id",
  input: { messages: [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?"}] },
  expectedOutput: { messages: [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?"}] },
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-id",
  input={ "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?"}] },
  expectedOutput={ "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?"}] },
)
```

</CodeGroup>


### Create Many

To create many datapoints in a single efficient operation:

<CodeGroup>

  ```typescript Node
  await montelo.datapoints.createMany({
    dataset: "dataset-id",
    datapoints: [
      {
        input: { messages: [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?"}] },
        expectedOutput: { messages: [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?"}] },
      }
    ]
  });
  ```

  ```python Python
  montelo.datapoints.create_many(
    dataset="dataset-id",
    datapoints=[
      {
        "input": { "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?"}] },
        expectedOutput: { "messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?"}] },
      }
    ],
  )
  ```

</CodeGroup>


## Train/Test

A datapoint can be in either the train/test split. By default, all datapoints are marked as train.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  split: "TEST" as const
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expected_output={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  split="TEST"
)
```

</CodeGroup>


Only the datapoints in the train split will be used for finetuning. The test datapoints are used for experiments.

## Metadata

You can add custom metadata to each datapoint.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  input: { topic: "Football" },
  expectedOutput: { joke: "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  metadata: { some: "metadata" }
});
```

```python Python
montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="dataset-slug",
  input={ "topic": "Football" },
  expected_output={ "joke": "Why did the soccer ball quit the team? Because it was tired of being kicked around!" },
  metadata={ "some": "metadata" }
)
```

</CodeGroup>
