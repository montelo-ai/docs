Fine-tuning on Montelo starts with a dataset. First, create a fine-tune dataset:

<Frame type="glass">
  <img src="/assets/fine-tuning/ftmodal.png" alt="Runs Overview"/>
</Frame>

This is a special type of dataset that follows the OpenAI `messages` format. Here is an example fine-tune dataset.

The input to the datapoint should be:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}]}
```

The output to the datapoint should be:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."}]}
```

Upload datapoints to this dataset in the following way:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Node
import OpenAI from "openai";

const inputMessages: OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
  {
    role: "system",
    content: "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
  },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "What's the capital of France?",
  }
];

const outputMessages: OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
  {
    role: "assistant",
    content: "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
  }
];

await montelo.datapoints.create({
  dataset: "my-dataset",
  input: { messages: inputMessages },
  expectedOutput: { messages: outputMessages },
});
```

```python Python
inputMessages = [
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What's the capital of France?",
  }
];

outputMessages = [
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
  }
];

montelo.datapoints.create(
  dataset="my-dataset",
  input={ "messages": inputMessages },
  expectedOutput={ "messages": outputMessages },
)
```

</CodeGroup>

Once that's done, you can go ahead and click fine-tune in the UI, and it'll start the fine-tune!
