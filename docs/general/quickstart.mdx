## Sign up for Montelo

To get started, you need to first [sign up](https://app.montelo.ai/auth/register) for a **free** account.

## Installing the SDK

Start by installing Montelo.

```sh
npm install montelo
```

## API Keys

After setting up your account, you can find your API key for the environment you want to use from the dashboard.

<Note>Each project has several environments, and each environment has it’s own API Key.</Note>

When developing in a team, it's a good idea to create a new environment for each developer.
This way, developers can work independently without interfering with each other's work.

With your API key in hand, you can now set up the SDK.
Either include the API key as an environment variable called `MONTELO_API_KEY` or pass it as an argument to the `Montelo` constructor.

```dotenv .env
MONTELO_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```


## Collect production requests

Now that you have the SDK set up, you can start using Montelo to collect production requests.

```typescript main.ts
import { Montelo } from "montelo";

const montelo = new Montelo();

await montelo.openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What is the meaning of life?",
    },
  ]
});
```

You should now be able to view logs and metrics in the Montelo dashboard.

## Start a trace

To trace multiple logs together, simply create a new trace:

```typescript
const trace = montelo.trace({ name: "Sample Trace" });

const span = await trace.span({ name: "Span - 1" });
await span.log({ name: "Log - 1.1" });
await span.log({ name: "Log - 1.2" });

const nestedSpan = await span.span({ name: "Nested Span - 1.3" });
await nestedSpan.log({ name: "Log - 1.3.1" });
await nestedSpan.log({ name: "Log - 1.3.2" });

await span.log({ name: "Log - 1.4" });

await trace.log({ name: "Log - 2" });
```

## Create a dataset

Create a dataset via our SDK.

```typescript
const dataset = await montelo.datasets.create({
  name: "Sentiment analysis",
  description: "Sentiment analysis dataset for project X",
  inputSchema: { sentence: "string" },
  outputSchema: { sentiment: "string" },
});

await montelo.datapoints.createMany({
  dataset: dataset.slug,
  datapoints: [ ... ], // upload here
});
```

## Run an experiment

Now that you have an uploaded dataset, you can run an experiment against it!

You supply a runner and an evaluator function that runs against each datapoint in the dataset. What you return from
the runner and evaluator are then logged and tracked for you to analyze in Montelo.

```typescript
await montelo.experiments.createAndRun({
  name: "My First Experiment",
  description: "So exciting!",
  dataset: dataset.slug,
  runner: async ({ input, metadata }) => {
    const sentiment = await llmRequest(input, metadata);
    return { sentiment }
  },
  evaluator: async ({ input, expectedOutput, actualOutput, metadata }) => {
    return {
      isCorrect: expectedOutput.sentiment === actualOutput.sentiment,
    }
  },
});
```

## Fine-tuning

To fine-tune a model on a dataset, first make sure that the dataset is a fine-tuning dataset. You can create a fine-tune
dataset either from the UI or the SDK.

Then, upload datapoints that follow the dataset schema.

Finally, go to the dataset's page on the UI and click on Fine-Tune. Select your model, and we'll take it from there and
fine-tune against the model on your dataset!
