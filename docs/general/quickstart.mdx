This quickstart will go over generating synthetic data and fine-tuning Llama-3 to classify financial newspaper tiles as
`positive`/`negative`/`neutral`.

## Sign up for Montelo

To get started, you need to first [sign up](https://app.montelo.ai/auth/register) for a **free** account.


## Input Your OpenAI API Key

Montelo uses your OpenAI API key to generate synthetic data. Input your OpenAI key on the dashboard to get started.

## Generate Synthetic Data

### Concept

Datasets on Montelo follow the [OpenAI conversation format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format).
Each datapoint within a dataset has an input and an expected output that is of the format `{ messages: Message[] }`.

Here is an example input/output pair of a datapoint.

<CodeGroup>

```json Input
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the capital of France?"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Output
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already."
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

With that in mind, to generate a dataset for classifying financial newspaper tiles as `positive`/`negative`/`neutral`,
we can use the following prompts:

<CodeGroup>

  ```json Input
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are given the task of classifying a sentence as Neutral, Negative, or Positive. First, try to reason over the problem, then come up with the answer. Return your answer in JSON format as { \"reasoning\", \"label\" }. Be brief and concise in your reasoning."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Sentence: Pretax profit rose to EUR 1,019 mn from EUR 1,007 in the corresponding period in 2005."
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ```json Output
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The profit increased from EUR 1,007 million to EUR 1,019 million, indicating growth.\",\n  \"label\": \"Positive\"\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

</CodeGroup>

We are using Chain of Thought prompting to have the LLM reason over the sentence before giving the answer.
