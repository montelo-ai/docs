## Trace

A trace is a collection that serves as an umbrella for LLM calls, vector db calls, or anything else you'd like to include.

Traces exist in two different contexts on Montelo:

1. Logs, for traces ran in production environments

2. Experiments, for traces ran inside an experiment

## Span

A span is a an object of the following basic properties:

- Name
- Input
- Output
- Metadata (cost, latency, start/end times, etc.)

You can imagine logging anything from LLM calls, to vector db calls, to 3rd party calls.

## Datapoints

A datapoint is a single object with the following basic properties:

- Input
- Expected output

When you define a datapoint in a dataset, you are saying that your system must adhere to producing the expected output
given the input.

## Dataset

A dataset is a collection of datapoints. Each dataset has an input and an output schema, which forces each datapoint
within the dataset to adhere to.

For example, if a dataset has an input schema of `{ sentence: "string" }`, then each datapoint has `{ sentence: "string" }`
as it's input.

### Fine-Tuning

A fine-tune dataset is a dataset specifically for fine-tuning. This is just a regular dataset, with a pre-set input/output
schema adhering to the OpenAI fine-tuning [format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format).

## Experiment

An experiment is a run of your application against a dataset. You supply a `runner` function to the experiment, which
calls your application code, and returns an output which will be tracked for analysis by Montelo.

## Eval

An eval is created for each datapoint within an experiment, that let's you define custom evaluations to determine whether
your system is performing properly.
