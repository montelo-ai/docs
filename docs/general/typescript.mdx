At Montelo, we ❤️ TypeScript. We've gone the extra length to ensure the most pleasant DX.

For example, you may define the input and output types of your dataset in your codebase like:

```typescript
export type DInput = {
  sentence: string;
};

export type DOutput = {
  sentiment: string;
};
```

And then when uploading a dataset, you may supply the types to our SDK:

```typescript
await montelo.datapoints.createMany<DInput, DOutput>({
  dataset: dataset.slug,
  datapoints: [ ... ],
});
```

If the array you supplied does not adhere to the proper type, you'll get an error! The same goes for running experiments
and evals:

```typescript
type DEvaluation = {
  isCorrect: boolean;
}

await montelo.experiments.createAndRun<DInput, DOutput, DEvaluation>({
  name: "Experiment name",
  description: "Experiment description",
  dataset: "dataset-slug",
  // this will complain since you returned the wrong type!
  // you should return DOutput
  runner: async () => {
    return { hello: "world" }
  },
  // this will complain since you returned the wrong type!
  // you should return DEvaluation
  evaluator: async () => {
    return { hello: "world" };
  },
});
```
