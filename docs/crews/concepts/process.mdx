#### What is a Process?

A process orchestrates the execution of tasks by agents. These processes make sure tasks are shared out according to a set plan.

The 2 processes are:

- `sequential`: tasks are executed in order.
- `managed`: tasks are organized in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on the instructions of the manager.

#### Sequential Process

This method follows a team's way of doing things, moving through tasks thoughtfully and methodically.
The execution of tasks adheres to a predetermined sequence in the task list, where the result of one task provides the context for the following one.

#### Managed Process

This process emulates a corporate hierarchy.

Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities and assesses task completion.

<Note>
  To enable the `managed` process you have to define the `managerModel`
  parameter which will be the model that powers the manager agent.
