Each log contains information about an event that occurred in your application. This could be a user interaction, a model completion, or anything else you want to track.

Logs are independent and by default are not linked to any other logs. You can group logs together using [traces](/traces/traces).

## Basic

Logging is automatically handled for you when using the Montelo SDK.

For example, when using the OpenAI SDK, you can log completions like this:

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

await montelo.openai.chat.completions.create({
  name: "A name for this completion",
  // OpenAI parameters
  ...
});
```

<Note>The `name` parameter is required. This is the name of the log, and it will be used to identify the log in the Montelo dashboard.</Note>

For a complete list of parameters, see the [SDK documentation](/sdk/montelo-class).

That is all you need to do to get started with logging.

## Manual

You can also manually log events using the `log` method.

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

montelo.log({
  name: "Browse the web",
  input: { some: "input" },
  output: { some: "output" },
  // ...
});
```

For a complete list of parameters, see the [SDK documentation](/sdk/montelo-class).
