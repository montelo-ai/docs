Traces allow you to group multiple logs together to easily debug, monitor, and analyze your application's flow.
By organizing related logs into a single trace, you can better understand how a request moves through your system, identify performance bottlenecks, and quickly pinpoint errors.

## Basic

To create a trace, use the `trace` method on a Montelo instance. This returns a new `Trace` instance for you to use.

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

const trace = montelo.trace({ name: "Example Trace" });

await trace.log(...); // log a vector db call
await trace.openai.chat.completions.create(...); // log an openai call
await trace.anthropic.messages.create(...); // log an anthropic call
```

All logs generated within the trace instance will be grouped together in the "Example Trace".

<Note>These logs will be added to the trace with no hierarchy. For hierarchical traces, see `Nesting` below.</Note>

## Nesting

Montelo makes it easy to create nested traces by simply adding a / to the log names. This allows you to organize your traces into a hierarchical structure without the need to manage identifiers or hierarchy yourself.

To create nested traces in Montelo, we simply add `/` to the individual log names.

For example, the following code creates a trace with the name `Parent`, and then creates a nested trace with the name `Child`.

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

const trace = montelo.trace({ name: "Example Trace" });

await trace.openai.chat.completions.create({ name: "Parent", ... });
await trace.anthropic.messages.create({ name: "Parent / Child", ... });
```

That's it! The logs will be grouped into a single trace with the name `Parent`, and the nested trace will be grouped into a single trace with the name `Child`.

You don't have to pass around identifiers or manage the hierarchy yourself. Montelo will automatically group the logs into the correct traces.

This is especially useful when you have a complex application, with many different components that you want to trace.

### Tip

You will most likely already know the names of the nesting beforehand, so you can use an Enum to define the names of the traces.

```typescript
const montelo = new Montelo();

enum TraceNames {
  BrowserAgent = "Browser Agent",
  PDFAgent = "PDF Agent",
}

const trace = montelo.trace({ name: "Trace Name" });

await trace.openai.chat.completions.create({
  name: `${TraceNames.BrowserAgent} / Browse search engine results`,
});
await trace.log({ ... });
await trace.openai.chat.completions.create({
  name: `${TraceNames.PDFAgent} / Read a pdf`,
});
```

## UI

The Montelo UI provides a visual representation of your traces, making it easy to debug, monitor, and analyze your application's flow.
