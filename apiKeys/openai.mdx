The [OpenAI Node.js SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node?tab=readme-ov-file#openai-node-api-library) exposes convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript.

The OpenAI constructor takes in the object defined below.

<Accordion title="See the object here.">
You can find the code snippet [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/6175eca426b15990be5e5cdb0e8497e547f87d8a/src/index.ts#L10).
```typescript
export interface ClientOptions {
  /**
   * Defaults to process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'].
   */
  apiKey?: string | undefined;

  /**
   * Defaults to process.env['OPENAI_ORG_ID'].
   */
  organization?: string | null | undefined;

  /**
   * Override the default base URL for the API, e.g., "https://api.example.com/v2/"
   *
   * Defaults to process.env['OPENAI_BASE_URL'].
   */
  baseURL?: string | null | undefined;

  /**
   * The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the client should wait for a response
   * from the server before timing out a single request.
   *
   * Note that request timeouts are retried by default, so in a worst-case scenario you may wait
   * much longer than this timeout before the promise succeeds or fails.
   */
  timeout?: number;

  /**
   * An HTTP agent used to manage HTTP(S) connections.
   *
   * If not provided, an agent will be constructed by default in the Node.js environment,
   * otherwise no agent is used.
   */
  httpAgent?: Agent;

  /**
   * Specify a custom `fetch` function implementation.
   *
   * If not provided, we use `node-fetch` on Node.js and otherwise expect that `fetch` is
   * defined globally.
   */
  fetch?: Core.Fetch | undefined;

  /**
   * The maximum number of times that the client will retry a request in case of a
   * temporary failure, like a network error or a 5XX error from the server.
   *
   * @default 2
   */
  maxRetries?: number;

  /**
   * Default headers to include with every request to the API.
   *
   * These can be removed in individual requests by explicitly setting the
   * header to `undefined` or `null` in request options.
   */
  defaultHeaders?: Core.Headers;

  /**
   * Default query parameters to include with every request to the API.
   *
   * These can be removed in individual requests by explicitly setting the
   * param to `undefined` in request options.
   */
  defaultQuery?: Core.DefaultQuery;

  /**
   * By default, client-side use of this library is not allowed, as it risks exposing your secret API credentials to attackers.
   * Only set this option to `true` if you understand the risks and have appropriate mitigations in place.
   */
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser?: boolean;
}
```

With Montelo, you still have access to these options, simply by adding them to the Montelo constructor.

```typescript
import { MonteloAI } from "montelo";

const montelo = new MonteloAI({
  openai: {}, // <- this is of type ClientOptions, as defined above.
});
```
