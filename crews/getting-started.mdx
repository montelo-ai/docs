In this simple tutorial we're building a crew comprised of a Researcher agent (with access to Google) and a blog post Writer agent. The crew has 2 tasks:

1. Research the latest news on the topic which the user inputted
2. Write up a structured blog post on these findings

#### 1. Installation

Install the `montelo` package in your project.

```sh Npm
npm install montelo
```

Now you have to setup you're montelo client ([guide](/general/quickstart)) and the model you want to use for the agents.
As before you can use a `.env` file or just inject the Montelo & OpenAI keys directly inside the Montelo class instantiation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using .env file" defaultOpen="true">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```typescript main.ts
      import { Agent, Crew, Model, Montelo, Task, Tools } from "montelo";

      const monteloClient = new Montelo();
      const model = new Model({ monteloClient, modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });
      ```

      ```dotenv .env
      MONTELO_API_KEY=your-api-key
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
      ````
    </CodeGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set API keys directly">
    ```typescript main.ts
      import { Agent, Model, Tools } from "montelo";

      const monteloClient = new Montelo({
        montelo: { apiKey: process.env.MONTELO_API_KEY },
        openai: { apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY },
      });
      const GPT3Model = new Model({ monteloClient, modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });

      ````

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Currently the `Model` class only supports OpenAI models. Support for more LLM
  providers is coming soon!
</Note>

#### 2. Configure Your Agents

To create your agents, use the `Agent` class to define:

- The **name** of the agent
- A description of the skillset and **role** of the agent.
- The LLM **model** which powers the agent (defined above).
- Any **tools** or functions you want to give them access to (we're using a pre-defined Google search tool).

```typescript
const researcher = new Agent({
  name: "Researcher",
  role: "You are a curious researcher. You love to find and explore the latest trends and news about {topic}.",
  tools: [Tools.GoogleSearchTool],
  model: GPT3Model,
});

const writer = new Agent({
  name: "Writer",
  role: "You are a passionate blog writer. You write engaging and informative blog posts about {topic}.",
  model: GPT3Model,
});
```

<Tip>
  You can use variables in your prompts, such as `{topic}`, which you can then
  pass in at runtime when you start the crew!
</Tip>

#### 3. Define the Tasks

Define the objectives that your agents will complete, including the expected output format and the agent responsible for the task.

```typescript
const researchTask = new Task({
  name: "Research Topic",
  description: "Identify the latest news and trends about {topic}.",
  expectedOutput: "A summary of all the findings about {topic}.",
  agent: researcher,
});

const writeTask = new Task({
  name: "Write Blog Post",
  description: "Write an engaging and informative blog post about {topic}.",
  expectedOutput:
    "A structured blog post with clear subheadings and optimized with keywords for SEO.",
  agent: writer,
});
```

#### 4. Assemble the Crew

Finally, combine the tasks to be completed by the crew, and watch the magic happen!
This is where you set any variables in the `promptInputs` parameter.
You can also specify the process in which the tasks are completed, either [sequentially or managed](/crews/concepts/process).

```typescript
const crew = new Crew({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  tasks: [researchTask, writeTask],
  process: "sequential",
});

const result = await crew.start({
  monteloClient,
  promptInputs: { topic: "LLMs" },
});
```

#### 5. Results

This is the final generated output blog of the crew's work.

#### 6. Monitoring & Debugging

You can also see a detailed log of the agents progress, costs and the output of each task on the Montelo [dashboard](https://app.montelo.ai/):
