#### What is an Agent?

An LLM powered entity that has a specific role and set of skills to complete tasks by working with other agents.
Here are some examples of agents:

- **Researcher** that finds information on Google using the `GoogleSearchTool`
- **Programmer** who takes requirements for a feature and writes the code for it
- **Website Scraper** that takes a URL and certain information to look for on a website
- **Evaluator** agent that looks at the output of other agents and rates whether or not it's a valid answer
- **Planner** that creates a step-by-step plan for a task to make sure all the requirements are fulfilled

#### Properties

These are the properties that are available when creating an Agent.

| Property                            | Type       | Description                                                                                        | Variables |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `name` <span class="red">\*</span>  | _String_   | The agent's name                                                                                   | No        |
| `role` <span class="red">\*</span>  | _String_   | A description of the tasks this agent is best suited for within the crew                           | Yes       |
| `model` <span class="red">\*</span> | _Model_    | The language model used by the agent to process and generate text                                  | N/A       |
| `systemMessage`                     | _String_   | Defines the goal this agent aims to achieve. This will guide its decision-making process           | Yes       |
| `tools`                             | _Tool[]_   | Functions that the agent can use to perform tasks ([tools guide](/crews/concepts/tool))            | No        |
| `callback`                          | _Function_ | A function that is called when the agent is done with a task. E.g. you can use this to log outputs | N/A       |

#### Creating an Agent

To create an agent, start by defining the LLM model you want to power it with.
Currently, only OpenAI models are supported, but support for other providers is coming soon.

Here is an example using all the properties:

```typescript Model
import { Agent, Model, Tools } from "montelo";

// Define the OpenAI model name and pass in the Montelo client as a parameter
const GPT4Model = new Model({ monteloClient, modelName: "gpt-4-turbo" });

// Instantiate the Agent class with its configuration
const researcher = new Agent({
  name: "Researcher",
  role: "You're a curious researcher. You love to find and explore the latest trends and news about {topic}.",
  model: GPT4Model,
  // (Optional) Giving it the ability to search Google
  tools: [Tools.GoogleSearchTool],
  // (Optional) System message
  systemMessage:
    "Format the findings in an easy-to-understand way for sharing with others.",
  // (Optional) Using the callback to log the outputs
  stepCallback: async (output) => {
    console.log(output);
  },
});
```

<Tip>
  Define variables in your prompts using curly braces, such as `{topic}`, which
  can be passed in at runtime when you start the crew!
</Tip>

You can now use this agent in for any Task or Crew!

#### FAQs & Tips

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What's the difference between the role and systemMessage?">
        Both the `systemMessage` and `role` are used in the system message to the model.
        However, the difference is that the `role` is provided to the `Manager` agent in a managed process to determine the right agent for a task.

        The `systemMessage` offers additional, private information or instructions to the agent.

        NOTE: The user message to the model is dynamically generated based on the task assigned to the agent.

    <Accordion title="What tools can I use? Can I build my own?">
        Yes, you can build your own or use one of our pre-built tools!
        Check out the [Tools](/crews/concepts/tool) docs for all the
        supported tools and instructions on how to build your own.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I use different models for different agents in the same crew?">
        Absolutely! We actually recommend doing this for keeping costs down and improving the performance and accuracy of your application.

        You should use smaller and cheaper models for simple tasks (e.g. GPT-3), and bigger models for more complex tasks where accuracy is very important (e.g. GPT-4).
