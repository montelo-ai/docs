#### What is a Task?

A Task is a specific action or objective assigned to an agent to complete.
Each task is associated with a particular agent that has the skills and tools necessary to complete it.

Tasks are crucial for organizing the workflow within a crew, ensuring that each component of the crew works towards a common goal in a coordinated manner.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of tasks:

- Research the latest news on a given topic
- Write a cold email based on the information we have on a potential customer
- Analyze financial data and generate a report
- Create a design mockup for a new product feature

#### Properties

These are the properties that are available when creating a Task.

| Property                                    | Type       | Description                                                                                 | Variables |

| `agent`                                     | _Agent_    | Specify which agent is responsible for the task ([agent guide](/crews/concepts/agent))      | N/A       |
| `tools`                                     | _Tool[]_   | Functions that the agent fulfilling this task can use ([tools guide](/crews/concepts/tool)) | No        |

#### Creating a Task

To create a new Task, you need to provide the required properties in the constructor.
Here's an example of creating a task using all the properties:

```typescript
import { Agent, Task } from "@montelo/crews";
import { CustomerDatabaseTool, ProductFeaturesTool } from "./tools";

const emailWriter = new Agent({ ... });

const coldEmailTask = new Task({
  name: "Write Cold Email",
  description:
    "Write a personalized cold email to {customerName} from {companyName}",
  // Using this to define the structure of the email:
  expectedOutput: `A well-structured email with the following sections:
    1. Engaging subject line
    2. Personalized greeting
    4. Explanation of how {productName} solves {painPoint}
    5. Call-to-action to schedule a demo or learn more
    6. Professional sign-off`,
  agent: emailWriter,
  // (Optional) Example tools to allow the agent to find out more about the product and customer
  tools: [CustomerDatabaseTool, ProductFeaturesTool],
  // (Optional) An example callback where we log potentially bad emails
  callback: async (output: string) => {
    const sentimentScore = await sentimentAnalysis(output);
    if (sentimentScore < 0.5) {
      console.warn(
        "Warning: The generated email might not have a positive sentiment. Please review and adjust."
      );
    }
  },
});
```

<Tip>
  Just like agents, you can define variables in your prompts using curly braces,
  such as `{customerName}`, which can be passed in at runtime when you start the
  crew!
</Tip>

In this example, we create a `coldEmailTask` which writes a personalized email to a customer, and it has a clear expected structure for the output.
When we start the crew you will have to pass in the variables we're using in the prompts: `customerName`, `companyName`, `productName`, `painPoint`.
