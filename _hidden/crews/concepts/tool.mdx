#### What is a Tool?

A tool is a function that extends the capabilities of an agent, enabling functionalities such as executing code, accessing the internet, and integrating with external applications, and much more.

Examples of utilities achievable through tools include:

- Reading and writing files
- Searching within a PDF file
- Scraping web content
- Integrating with CRMs

#### Using Tools

Tools are very easy to use! Whether you're using custom tools, or the tools Montelo provides, simply include it as a parameter in the agent's configuration.
Here is an example using the `GoogleSearchTool` from the `montelo` package:

```typescript
import { Agent, Tools } from "montelo";

const someResearchAgent = new Agent({
  tools: [Tools.GoogleSearchTool],
  // other params...
});
```

#### Available Montelo Tools

We have our own set of tools we offer you, and are constantly building more:

#### Create your own Tool

To create your own tool you must first install zod, and use it to define the input schema for your tool.
You can read more on these schemas in the [Zod Documentation](https://zod.dev/?id=basic-usage).

In the following example, we create a simple tool that accepts a location and a temperature unit parameters, then returns a weather summary as a string.

**1. Install Zod**

```sh
npm i --save zod
```

**2. Define input schema**

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { Tool } from "montelo";

// Input Schema
const FunctionInput = z.object({
  // Make sure to describe each parameter
  location: z.string().describe("The city, e.g San Francisco."),
  unit: z.enum(["Celsius", "Fahrenheit"]).describe("The unit of temperature."),
});
type TFunctionInput = z.infer<typeof FunctionInput>; // Converts schema into TS type
```

**3. Write the tool**

```typescript
// Make sure you use the `TFunctionInput` type for params
const getCurrentWeather = async (params: TFunctionInput): Promise<string> => {
  // This is where you'd fetch real weather data
  return `The weather in ${params.location} is currently 22 degrees ${params.unit}.`;
};

// Tool
export const GetCurrentWeatherTool = new Tool({
  name: "GetCurrentWeather",
  function: getCurrentWeather,
  schema: FunctionInput,
  description: "Get the current weather in a given location.",
});
```

<Warning>
  Avoid using spaces or special characters in tool names to prevent issues
  during tool calling from the model.
</Warning>
<Tip>
  Providing clear descriptions for your tool and its parameters is crucial.
  These descriptions guide the agent in determining the tool's applicability to
  its task.
