#### What is a Crew?

A Crew represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks.
Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow using the `process` parameter.

#### Creating a Crew

Depending on the `process` you would like the crew to adhere to, there's a slightly different way to define the crew.

Here is an example:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Sequential
import { Crew } from "montelo";

// Define the agents, tasks and tools...

const crew = new Crew({
  name: "Cool Crew",
  process: "sequential",
  agents: [agent1, agent2],
  tasks: [task1, task2],
  tools: [SomeRandomTool],
  verbose: true,
  eventCallback: async ({ event, message, agent, task }) => {
    console.log(`${event} - ${task} - ${agent} - ${message});
  },
});
````

```typescript Managed
import { Crew } from "montelo";

// Define the agents, tasks and tools...

const crew = new Crew({
  name: "Cool Crew",
  process: "managed",
  managerModel: "gpt-4-0125-preview",
  agents: [agent1, agent2],
  tasks: [task1, task2],
  tools: [SomeRandomTool],
  verbose: true,
  eventCallback: async ({ event, message, agent, task }) => {
    console.log(`${event} - ${task} - ${agent} - ${message});
  },
});
````

</CodeGroup>

#### Starting The Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `start()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

<Note>
  This is where you pass in any variables that you have defined in the Agent and
  Task prompts (e.g. `topic`).
</Note>

```typescript
const output = await await crew.start({
  monteloClient,
  promptInputs: { topic: "Cats" },
});
```
